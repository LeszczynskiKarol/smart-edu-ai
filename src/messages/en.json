            "answer": "Generating a complete master's thesis (80-120 pages) takes 90 to 120 minutes. After this time, you will receive a finished thesis with scientific bibliography and all required structural elements."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "Will the thesis be unique and at master's level?",

          "q3": {
            "question": "Can I edit the generated thesis?",
            "answer": "Of course! You can download the thesis in DOCX format, which allows full editing in programs such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You can freely modify the content, add your own research and adjust the formatting."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "What scientific sources does AI use?",
            "answer": "AI uses verified academic sources, scientific publications, monographs, scientific journals and articles from credible databases. Each thesis contains a complete bibliography with 25-40 sources in appropriate citation format."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "Will the thesis meet my university's requirements?",
            "answer": "AI generates theses according to the highest academic standards. You can provide specific requirements of your university (citation format, structure, formal requirements, methodology), and AI will adapt the thesis to these guidelines."

          "q6": {
            "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the thesis?",
            "answer": "After generating the thesis, you can download and review it in detail. If something doesn't meet your expectations, you can edit the thesis yourself in DOCX format or contact our support."

          "q7": {
            "question": "What is the difference between a bachelor's and master's thesis?",
            "answer": "A master's thesis is longer (80-120 pages vs 60-90), contains more scientific sources (25-40 vs 15-30), has a more advanced research methodology and requires deeper topic analysis. AI generates content at a higher scientific level for master's theses."
